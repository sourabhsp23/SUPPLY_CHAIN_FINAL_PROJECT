An advanced, "next level" multi-model AI system designed to predict and mitigate supply chain disruptions across the Indian logistics network, featuring a high-performance 3D animated frontend.

## 🚀 Architecture

This project has been upgraded from a Streamlit application to a modern **Full-Stack AI Application**:

- **Frontend:** Built with **React 19**, **Three.js** (via React Three Fiber), and **GSAP**. It provides a sleek, interactive 3D visualization of the supply chain network across 15 major Indian cities.
- **Backend:** A robust **FastAPI** service that handles model inference, weather data fetching, and risk assessment.
- **AI Models:**
  - **Isolation Forest:** Anomaly detection for weather patterns.
  - **LSTM (Deep Learning):** Captures temporal dependencies in disruption sequences.
  - **XGBoost:** The final classifier for precise risk scoring.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **3D Interactive Globe/Map:** Stylized 3D visualization of logistics nodes with animated route arcs.
*   **GSAP Powered Animations:** Fluid UI transitions and "next level" visual feedback.
*   **Real-time Weather Intelligence:** Integrates live 7-day weather forecasts via Open-Meteo API.
*   **Explainable AI:** Detailed breakdown of "Risk Causes" for every shipment prediction.
*   **Modern UI:** Glassmorphism-inspired design using **Tailwind CSS**.
